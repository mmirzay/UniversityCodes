# UniversityCodes
 ### All codes programmed when I was student.
This folder contains most of the code I did when I was a student, my first code in 2010 and maybe the last one in 2017. 
I committed these codes here without changing them so that I can review them later as a memory (maybe a bad one).
Interestingly, I got the highest scores in all these codes during assessments.
Certainly with the experience I gained at work, I can write these codes much better. Maybe one day I did.
